    <h2>Scalable Optimization</h2>
    <p>
			The decision-making for complex systems requires solving challenging optimization problems.

    <h2>Learning for Control</h2>
    <p>
			In a wide range of applications, the control system must operate within uncertain and dynamic environments, often with only partial observation of the system. Maintaining stability, robustness, and high operational performance under such conditions presents a formidable challenge, necessitating the study of data-driven control methods.

			Our research group is dedicated to the development of data-driven control methods tailored for complex physical systems, where data may be expensive and only a partial understanding of the system is available. Leveraging the tools from { control theory }, { statistics }, and { reinforcement learning }, we aim  to advance the fundamental understanding and to create novel computational strategies for data-driven control. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Specific research focus areas are as follows.
			<ul>
				<li>
					Studying the fundamental issues of data-driven control methods, such as sample complexity, regret, and computational complexity.
				<li>
					Addressing the sample complexity issue of data-driven control methods via the exploitation of system structure.
				<li>
					Developing the system identification and control methods for non-traditional sensors and actuators (e.g., image-based control)

    <h2>High-Performance Computing</h2>
    <p>
			State-of-the-art numerical software tools have made significant progress in solving optimization problems at a moderately large scale. However, they still face limitations when dealing with extremely large-scale problems that involve more than millions of variables. Fortunately, recent advancements in { GPU computing } and the introduction of { exascale supercomputers } present exciting opportunities to develop more efficient and versatile numerical optimization tools. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Our research group aims to enhance our capabilities to solve such large-scale optimization problems by harnessing the power of { high-performance computing }, especially by exploiting { GPU computing } capabilities. This requires developing new algorithmic ideas as well as implementing them as efficient numerical software packages. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Specifically, we focus on the following areas:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Development of a comprehensive nonlinear optimization framework that can fully exploit the capabilities of DOE's leadership-class supercomputers like { Aurora }, { Summit }, and { Frontier }. These frameworks will incorporate general-purpose algebraic modeling systems, domain-specific modeling tools, automatic differentiation frameworks, numerical linear solvers, and numerical optimization solvers.
				<li>
					Building computational infrastructure for optimization with neural-network surrogate models that interface the machine learning frameworks with nonlinear programming solvers.

    <h2>Energy Systems</h2>
    <p>
			Society is confronting the unprecedented challenge of decarbonizing energy systems to mitigate climate change. To decarbonize the U.S. energy systems by 2050, we will need to produce at least 40% of the nation's total energy demand from wind and solar, which is far higher than the current 12%. Achieving this goal will require extensive research efforts on decision-making frameworks to design, plan, and operate decarbonized energy systems with high efficiency and reliability.
